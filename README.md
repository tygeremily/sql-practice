# sql-practice
Use SQL in R to explore a dataset of airline delays. 

## Introduction
This project shows examples of SQL queries in R that were used to find potential patterns or explanations for flight delays. The dataset used for this project comes from the ASA Section on Statistical Computing and Statistical Graphics (https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/home).  This website contains all of the files that I downloaded, merged together through shell commands and then created the AirlineDelay.sqlite3 database used in the file.  

I have also included the html output of the file that can be downloaded to show the results of the queries and visualizations generated.
